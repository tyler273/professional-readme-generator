# Professional ReadMe Generator

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package and Node.js.

## Usage

Upon initilization the application the user must simply answer the questions in the console and a readME markdown file will be generated!
